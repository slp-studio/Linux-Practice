This is a very simple Linux training file, so it won't directly affect your PC. Also, because it's a very small exe file, the files aren't saved separately. Additionally, this Linux only supports very simple commands. Complex commands like pacman won't work. If you need a more robust Linux system later, I recommend downloading a Linux distribution like Debian or Ubuntu instead of this workbook.
